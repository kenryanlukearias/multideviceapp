                <h1>What Is Washoku?</h1>
                <p>Another name for Japanese cuisine is “Washoku” 和食, where 和 means ‘Japan’ or ‘harmony,’ 食 means ‘food’ or ‘to eat.’ As implied in the kanji (漢字; Chinese characters), Washoku harmoniously blends the ingredients for a nutritious and beautifully presented meal.<br><br>

                The key features of washoku include:

                Balance and Harmony: Washoku balances flavors, colors, and textures. It incorporates the five basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and umami.
                Seasonality: Ingredients are chosen based on their seasonal availability, known as “shun.” Seasonal foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and seafood, are believed to be at their peak flavor and nutritional value (more below).
                Presentation: Aesthetic presentation is highly valued. Meals are often arranged to be visually appealing, and great care is taken in selecting serving dishes and utensils.
                Techniques: Washoku employs various cooking techniques, including raw preparations , grilling, steaming, simmering, and deep-frying. Each method is chosen to enhance the natural flavors of the ingredients.
                Rice as a Staple: Japanese short-grain rice is a fundamental component of washoku and is often served with every meal. It is considered the main source of energy for the Japanese.
                Use of Fresh and Local Ingredients: Washoku emphasizes using fresh, local, and seasonal ingredients. This reflects a connection to the natural environment and an appreciation for regional flavors.
                Ceremonial Aspects: Washoku can extend beyond the actual meal to include traditional dining etiquette and celebratory dishes.</p></div>

                <p class="p_curry">The term is a recent creation from the Meiji period (1868-1912), the beginning of Japan’s modernization and industrialization from the feudal era. Until then, contact with foreign countries was severely restricted under the Tokugawa Shogunate. As Japan opened its borders, an influx of new cultures (and food!) arrived from European nations and the U.S.<br><br>

                The consumption of beef and pork, once considered taboo by Buddhist practice (but secretly consumed throughout centuries), quickly spread among the Japanese and fusion dishes such as Nikujaga (肉じゃが), Curry (カレー), Tonkatsu (トンカツ), and Croquette (コロッケ) were born.<br><br>
                
                To distinguish traditional Japanese cuisine from exotic Western cuisine (西洋料理) and western influenced Japanese cuisine called Yoshoku (洋食), the term Washoku was cooked up.</p>

            <h1>The Four Seasons</h1>
            <p>The four distinct seasons also play a crucial role in Japanese dishes. While the changing seasons are not unique to the country, the seasonal cycle is deeply infused in Japanese culture, displayed in traditional arts, poetry, dress attire, and cuisine. This respect for nature’s cycle can be seen in Shun (旬; “season”) when produce reaches its peak flavor and nutritional value.<br><br>

                This seasonal awareness of the cuisine is one of the defining aspects of Washoku.<br><br>
                
                Examples are plump green peas and hamaguri clams in the spring, spicy shishito peppers and Japanese whiting in the summer, woody matsutake mushrooms and pike eel in the fall, and herbal shungiku greens and buri yellowtail in the winter.<br><br>
                
                Rice also has its shun, known as shin-mai, or newly harvested rice (新米). It is prized for its characteristic moist and tender texture, only available for a short window. During this time of year, you will see supermarkets displaying bags of shin-mai.<br><br>
                
                You may also see seasonal motifs painted on plates and bowls at kaiseki restaurants. For example, you may notice a little sprig of tender green leaves or a vivid red maple leaf adding color to the dish.</p>
